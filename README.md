# ASLEducation
This project will develop a model that can accurately interpret ASL gestures. We will create an application where users can interact in real-time and receive feedback on the gestures they make. The model will predict what letter is being signed in real-time. We plan on recognizing entire words; for now, the project will focus on the ASL alphabet.
